# pca10059-bootloaded

The dongle comes with a dfu bootloader and from nordic.

## prereqs

* [nrfdfu](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/nrfdfu-rs) `cargo install nrfdfu`

## flash

* press reset (the sideways button) button to enable bootloader
* `cargo run` or use vscode run button

Since its dfu bootloaded the dev profile is setup just like a release profile so you don't need `--release`

## to get the stock bootlaoder back if you lost it

Youll need a jlink programmer and the tagconnect spring connector (but you would have probably needed that to remove the bootloader in the first place).

* download [nrfjprog](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Command-Line-Tools)
